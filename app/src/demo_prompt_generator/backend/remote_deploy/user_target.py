"""Cross-workspace deploy target resolution (v2 — per-project pinning).

TWO levels:
  • USER-level "current target" — an account setting (set on the home page,
    `UserSettings.target_workspace_host`). This is only the DEFAULT for NEW
    projects.
  • PROJECT-level "pinned target" — `Project.target_workspace_host`, FROZEN the
    first time a project deploys cross-workspace. Once pinned it is immutable:
    the project deploys to that same target forever, even if the user later
    switches their account setting. INVARIANT: no mixed targets within a project.

Use `resolve_project_target(...)` on every build/deploy/link path — it returns
the project's pinned host when set, and only falls back to the live per-user
value for a project's very first deploy (or a legacy project created before
pinning existed). `resolve_user_target(...)` (per-user, DB-free) remains for the
new-project default + the freeze source.

USER resolution order (the freeze source / new-project default):
  1. the user's saved `UserSettings.target_workspace_host`
  2. the server default `config.default_target_workspace_host`
  3. None → classic same-workspace OBO (nothing changes)

The pure `resolve_user_target` is DB-free (unit-tested); the DB helpers upsert
by email, since deployed mode never persists a `users` row.

    per-project PIN.

    A project's target is FROZEN the first time it deploys cross-workspace (see
    `pin_project_target`). Once pinned, that value is authoritative forever — even
    if the user later changes their account-level target. This is the invariant:
    a project sticks to the target it first built against; no mixed targets per
    project.

    Falls back to the live per-user setting ONLY when the project has never been
    pinned (its first deploy, or a legacy project created before pinning existed).
    Normalized to https://<host>, or None for classic same-workspace OBO.

    LEGACY GUARD (`has_built_resources`): a project that ALREADY has built
    resources but no pinned target is a LEGACY (pre-Model-3) project — its
    resources were provisioned via OBO on the app's OWN workspace. Falling back
    to the user's live remote-target setting here would pin the WRONG workspace
    (the resource tiles + iterate would then query a workspace that doesn't hold
    the resources → access failures). So when `has_built_resources` is True and
    the project is unpinned, resolve to the app's OWN host (`config.databricks_host`,
    where the resources actually live) instead of the live user setting. A pinned
    project is unaffected (its pin already wins); a brand-new empty project is
    unaffected (the user's picker still drives its first target).

    HARD GATE: like `resolve_user_target`, returns None whenever the feature is
    off — even for an already-pinned project. So a project pinned while the
    feature was enabled stops resolving its target the moment the feature is
    disabled, and no downstream path can act on the stranded host."""
