"""Cross-workspace target validation (v1).

Before a project deploys to a user-pasted workspace URL, validate it AS THE
DEPLOYER SP in three tiers — all detectable with the SP's own OAuth-M2M creds,
no account-admin required:

  1. REACHABLE — can the SP authenticate to the workspace at all? An account
     SP's token is only accepted by workspaces in its OWN account (FEVM AWS
     Stable). Cross-account → token/OIDC failure. This is also exactly the
     account where Cross-Workspace Network Policy (CWNP) is enabled, so
     "reachable" ⟺ "in FEVM AWS Stable" ⟺ "cross-workspace deploy can work".
  2. ADMIN — is the SP in the workspace's `admins` group? A full `bundle
     deploy` sets run_as/ownership to the user, which a non-admin SP cannot do
     (verified: 403 "Non-admins can set run_as to themselves only"). If not
     admin, the user (who owns the workspace) can add the SP as a workspace
     admin via the workspace UI.
  3. CATALOG — does the target's region map to a provisioned catalog?

The probe is dependency-injected (`scim_me`, `region_of`) so it's unit-testable
without a network. The route layer supplies real implementations built on the
deployer SP's WorkspaceClient.
