"""WebSocket endpoint for live multi-user architecture editing.

``/api/projects/{id}/collab`` — one socket per open Architecture tab. Auth mirrors
the HTTP routes (owner/admin/editor = edit, accepted-viewer = presence-only,
anyone else = 404-equivalent close). Identity comes from the same
``X-Forwarded-Email`` / ``-Preferred-Username`` headers HTTP uses. All the room
logic lives in ``services.collab.CollabHub``; this file is just the socket
plumbing: accept → auth → join → send initial snapshot → relay loop → leave.
