"""Grounding — /api/grounding/scan.

"Use existing data": the user picks real Unity Catalog tables to build the demo
ON. This endpoint scans those tables (schema + light stats + a few sample rows)
BEFORE the project exists and warms the process-level cache the capability-suggest
endpoint reads from, so the proposed stories are grounded in the actual tables.

Runs as the app service principal (Apps OBO tokens can't run warehouse queries)
on a warehouse resolved by `pick_query_warehouse`.
