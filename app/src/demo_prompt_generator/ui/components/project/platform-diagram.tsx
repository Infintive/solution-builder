/**
 * PlatformDiagram — the architecture tab's interactive canvas.
 * ============================================================
 *
 * A Lucidchart-style editor for the demo's Databricks architecture, built on
 * ReactFlow (@xyflow/react):
 *
 *   • Brand-icon component nodes, draggable; positions persist to architecture.md.
 *   • A component LIBRARY palette (left) — drag a component onto the canvas to
 *     add it, delete a node to remove it.
 *   • Editable, animated edges — connect nodes by dragging from their dots,
 *     toggle the "data flowing" red-dot animation, reposition, persist.
 *   • Click a node → a detail panel with its description + live deep-link.
 *   • Special nodes: source tiles (vendor logos), a vertical "Lakeflow Connect"
 *     rail, and an SDP node that shows bronze/silver/gold as little tables.
 *
 * Persistence: on any layout change we debounce-save the whole architecture.md
 * (semantic bands preserved, `layout` block rewritten) via saveProjectFile.
 *
 * Schema/layout resolution lives in `lib/platform-architecture`; this file is
 * the canvas + interactions.
